Supervised by ABDUL RAFIEZ BIN ABDUL RAZIFF

**Project Description**

Our project theme is based on 6th goals in Sustainable Development Goals which is clean water and sanitation. Conway is a non-government organisation (NGO) established as one way to achieve the goal. Conway focused on supplying water in remote areas in Malaysia. From stats only about 71% in Kelantan and 62% people in Selangor reported that they did not have access to clean water.

Our website consists of 6 pages which are homepage, about us, donation, our works and contact. We use blue as our main colour for the website symbolic to the colour of water and representing inspiration that we bring to others. We use white as our main font colour to make our website easy to read and use, while making it tidier and clean. Our main concern to design our website is to make our website as simple as we can to ease the user or community to access the website and not confuse the user.

Users can know and learn about our organisation in the about us page. Here we will provide our objective and organisation flow. Then, users may see our montage video and result from our past visits and community service at Our works page. After that, we also created a donation page to encourage users to support us in our mission which is to provide everyone with clean water. And lastly, users can find a way to contact us in contact us page filled with our WhatsApp number, email, and other social media which we will update our works on frequently.
