**Project Description**

Our project theme is based on 6th goals in Sustainable Development Goals which is clean

water and sanitation. Conway is a non-government organisation (NGO) established as one way

to achieve the goal. Conway focused on supplying water in remote areas in Malaysia. From

stats only about 71% in Kelantan and 62% people in Selangor reported that they did not have

access to clean water.

Our website consists of 6 pages which are homepage, about us, donation, our works

and contact. We use blue as our main colour for the website symbolic to the colour of water and

representing inspiration that we bring to others. We use white as our main font colour to make

our website easy to read and use, while making it tidier and clean. Our main concern to design

our website is to make our website as simple as we can to ease the user or community to

access the website and not confuse the user.

Users can know and learn about our organisation in the about us page. Here we will

provide our objective and organisation flow. Then, users may see our montage video and result

from our past visits and community service at Our works page. After that, we also created a

donation page to encourage users to support us in our mission which is to provide everyone with

clean water. And lastly, users can find a way to contact us in contact us page filled with our

WhatsApp number, email, and other social media which we will update our works on frequently.
